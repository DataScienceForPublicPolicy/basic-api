# Basic API service

As an illustration of how API services work, this repository covers basic steps in setting up a locally hosted service. 


##Getting started

Create a housing price scoring API for real estate in Brooklyn, NY


##Pretrain a model


##Set up `get` requests

`get`, `post`, `put`

##Score a building service

`http://localhost:8000/score?bclass=3&year=2000&gsf=1500&lsf=2340&zip=11230`

##Beyond

To make available to the world, the API needs to be hosted on cloud infrastructure. Setting up a hosting environment is beyond the scope of this tutorial; However, consider reviewing this documentation: [
